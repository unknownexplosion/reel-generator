# ðŸ”§ ElevenLabs API Fallback System

## Issue: ElevenLabs Free Tier Blocked

Your ElevenLabs API is currently blocked due to "unusual activity detection". This is common with free tier accounts.

## âœ… Automatic Fallback Solution

The app now automatically handles this by:

1. **Text Overlay**: When voice generation fails, text is overlaid on the video
2. **Background Audio**: Subtle background tones instead of silence
3. **Seamless Experience**: Users still get functional reels

## ðŸŽ¯ What Users See Now

- Upload images/videos âœ…
- Add description text âœ…
- Get reel with text overlay instead of voice âœ…
- Download working reel âœ…

## ðŸ”„ To Restore Voice Generation

**Option 1: Wait & Retry**
- ElevenLabs may restore free tier access after some time

**Option 2: Upgrade ElevenLabs**
- Purchase a paid ElevenLabs plan
- Update API key in Railway environment variables

**Option 3: Alternative TTS**
- Could integrate Google TTS, Azure Speech, or other services

## ðŸ“± Current User Experience

The app still works perfectly - users get reels with:
- Their uploaded images/videos
- Text overlaid on the video (instead of voice)
- Background audio for engagement
- Full download functionality

**The app remains fully functional for demonstrations!**
